# Special Thanks

The original author of this codebase would like to give special thanks for Stronk as follows:

The RPG Maker MV devs for their creation and maintenance of CoreEngine.

MushroomCake28 (last.truong@hotmail.com) for Options Systems Plus, which the options menu of this engine was based on.

Yanfly (http://www.yanfly.moe/) for an extensive plugin library that has proven invaluable for inspiration. A significant portion of YEP_CoreEngine's fixes are built into this codebase.

The Yanfly RPG Maker Discord for conversation, inspiration and advice during this project.

The Dunelm Digital Trade Tribe for their patience whilst their co-worker rambled about a Typescript game engine they were working on.
